# Jarvis - Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

"Jarvis" is a voice-activated virtual assistant inspired by Alexa and Google Assistant. This assistant leverages speech recognition and natural language processing to perform a variety of tasks, including opening websites, playing songs, providing news updates, and answering questions using OpenAI's language model.

## Features
- **Voice Commands**: Supports voice-activated commands for tasks such as:
  - Opening websites (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook)
  - Playing specific songs on YouTube
  - Fetching and reading out the latest news
  - Answering general questions with OpenAI's language model

## Requirements
Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install openai speechrecognition pyttsx3 gTTS pygame requests
```

## Project Structure
- main.py: Main program that activates Jarvis, recognizes voice commands, and processes them.
- client.py: Handles requests to OpenAI's API for natural language processing.
- musicLib.py: Contains a dictionary of song names and corresponding YouTube links for playback.

## Usage
1. Add API Keys:
     - Add your OpenAI API key in client.py and main.py.
      - (Optional) If using the News API, add your News API key in main.py.
2. Run the Program:
   - Start the assistant by running the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Voice Activation:
     - Say "Jarvis" to activate the assistant, followed by your command (e.g., "open Google" or "play popstar").
